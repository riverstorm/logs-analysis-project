# Logs Analysis Project

<b>This python script is used to analyse the logs in a sql database. The database is provided by Udacity</b>
<br><br>
The script contains three database queries, while every query is used to answer one of the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>What are the most popular three articles of all time?</li>
  <li>Who are the most popular article authors of all time?</li>
  <li>On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?</li>
</ul>

## An Udacity Project
The project is part of my Udacity course and requires a database file that is not included in this repository.

## Installation
### Requirements
<ul>
  <li>A Windows, Mac or Linux machine with Python 3</li>
